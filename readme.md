# Mandycan

Mandycan is an ASP.NET Core project generator. It's goal is to minimize writing boilerplate code so that you can get to work faster.

## How do I use it?

For the moment, youll need to clone the repo, cd into the mandycan-master directory and run <code>dotnet run new yourAppName</code>. Ideally, you'll want to point to this directory and give it an alias, so that you can use it globally via terminal or cmd prompt. Then you can run: <code>mandycan new projectName</code> globally.


## Isnt this the same thing as CandyMan?

Yes and No. It emulates the same structure that candyman does, but is written in C# and will soon offer you the ability to create controllers, models, views and more as opposed to just generating a project.
